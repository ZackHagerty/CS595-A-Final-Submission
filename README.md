# CS595-A-Final-Submission

This is the final submission for our CS595A Project. The project consists of a Google Collab notebook with a backend and frontend application. The backend consists of functionality that interfaces with StyleGan2's generator to create character portraits. The frontend is a user-hosted streamlit web browser interface that the user can use to cycle through generated character portraits.
